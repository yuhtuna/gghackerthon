# Findable - A Chrome Extension

Everything is findable.

## AI Features Setup

To use the AI-powered features of this extension, you need to enable a couple of flags in Chrome:

1.  Navigate to `chrome://flags` in your browser.
2.  Enable the following flags:
    *   `#prompt-api-for-gemini-nano`
    *   `#optimization-guide-on-device-model`
3.  Relaunch your browser.

After relaunching, you may need to wait for the on-device model to be downloaded. You can check the status at `chrome://components` under "Optimization Guide On Device Model".
